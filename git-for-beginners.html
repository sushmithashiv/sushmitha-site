                <P>If you‚Äôre a non-techie, and wondered what on earth ‚ÄùGit‚Äù actually is, then you‚Äôre not alone. A recent poll of digital marketing managers discovered that despite whilst more than 80% of them had heard of Git before, less than half could even describe what it did or what it was used for. </P>
                <p>If you guys quickly search on <strong>Google</strong> about <strong>So, What Git and GitHub</strong> it says that:</p>
                <blockquote cite="https://www.google.com/search?q=git">
                    <div>"It allows groups of developers to collaborate on the same documents (often source code) simultaneously and without overriding each other‚Äôs work.  "</div>
                </blockquote>
            </div>

            <br>

            <h2>So, What is a Version Control System?</h2>
            <p> <strong> Version control </strong> is ‚Äúa system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later.‚Äù </p>
            <p>First thing first, try reading "<strong>version control</strong>" as "<strong>control version</strong>". A <strong>Version Control System (VCS)</strong> or also called as <strong>Source Code Manager (SCM)</strong> is just software that helps
                you control (or manage) the different versions of something (typically your Source Code).
            </p>
            <p>Git is an <strong>SCM</strong> (and therefore a <strong>VCS</strong>!). The URL for the Git website is "<strong>https://git-scm.com/</strong>" (and you can see how it has "SCM" directly in its domain!). </p>
            <h2>There are a lot of Version Control Systems: </h2>
            <ul class="blog-unordered-list">
                <li>SVN</li>
                <li>GIT</li>
                <li>Mercurial</li>
                <li>Bazaar</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>But, there are two main types of Version Control Systems:</h2>
            <ol class="blog-ordered-list">
                <li>The <strong>Centralized Model</strong> - where, all users connect to a central, master repository.</li>
                <li>The <strong>Distributed Model</strong> - where, each user has the entire repository on their computer.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Git Terminologies / Keywords :</h2>
            <ol class="blog-ordered-list">
                <li>
                    <h3>Repository / Repo:</h3>
                    <p>
                        A Repository is a <strong>directory</strong>(folder) which contains your project work, which are used to communicate with Git. Repositories can exist either locally on your computer or as a remote copy on another computer. A repository
                        is made up of commits.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Commit:</h3>
                    <p>An individual change to a file (or set of files). It's like when you <strong> save </strong>(commit) a file, except with Git, every time you save it creates a unique ID (the "SHA" or "hash") that allows you to keep record of what changes were made when and by who. 
                        Commits usually contain a commit message which is a brief description of what changes were made.‚Äù</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Working Directory:</h3>
                    <p>The Working Directory(Folder) are the files that you see in your computer's file system. When you open your project files on a code editor, you're working with files in the Working Directory. This is in contrast to the files that have
                        been saved (in commits) in the repository.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Branch:</h3>
                    <p>Branch in Git is similar to the <strong>branch of a tree</strong>.</p>
                    <p>It is contained within the repository, but does not affect the primary or master branch allowing you to work freely without disrupting the "live" version.</p>
                    <p>The beauty about ‚Äòbranches‚Äô is that you can merge it back into the master branch when you‚Äôre ready to publish your changes.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Fetch:</h3>
                    <p><strong>Fetching </strong>refers to getting the latest changes from an online repository (like GitHub.com) without merging them in.
                         Once these changes are fetched you can compare them to your local branches (the code residing on your local machine).</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Fork:</h3>
                    <p>A <strong>Fork</strong> is a personal copy of another user's repository that lives on your GitHub account.</p>
                    <p>Forks allow you to freely make changes to a project without affecting the original, enabling limitless opportunities for experimentation and learning from other people‚Äôs work.</p>
                    <p>A forked project also remains attached to the original, allowing you to submit a pull request to the original's author to update with your changes, ensuring you‚Äôre always working off a recent or up-to-date codebase.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Issue:</h3>
                    <p><strong>Issues </strong> unsurprisingly are exactly as they sound. Issues are suggested improvements, tasks or questions related to the repository.</p>
                    <p>Issues can be created by anyone (for public repositories), and are moderated by repository collaborators. Each issue contains its own discussion forum, can be labeled and assigned to a user.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Blame:</h3>
                    <p>‚ÄúThe <strong>Blame</strong> feature in Git describes the last modification to each line of a file, which generally displays the revision, author and time. This is helpful, for example, in tracking down when a feature was added, or which commit led to a particular bug.‚Äù</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Merge:</h3>
                    <p>Merging takes the changes from one branch (in the same repository or from a fork), and applies them into another.</p>
                    <p>A merge can be done automatically via a Pull Request via the GitHub.com web interface if there are no conflicting changes, or can always be done via the command line.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Staging Area / Staging Index / Index: </h3>
                    <p>A file in the Git directory that stores information about what will go into your next commit. You can think of the staging area as a prep table where Git will take the next commit. Files on the Staging Index are poised to be added
                        to the repository.</p>
                </li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Some of the Basic but Important Commands of Git:</h2>
            <ol class="blog-ordered-list">
                <li>
                    <h3>git init: </h3>
                    <p>
                        Running this command will create a new git repository from scratch. It is also used to initialize the existing project folder as a git repository. <br> Example:
                        <code>git init</code>
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>git add :</h3>
                    <p> This command will add the file or files that u specify to the staging area or the index. You can run this command as many times as you need. But, Remember before commiting the files it will keep in the staging area. Instead of listing
                        all file names one by one, you can use "." after "git add" to select all files under the current directory.
                        <br> Example:<code>git add filename or git add .</code>
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>git status: </h3>
                    <p> you want to see what you have in the Staging Area and ready for commit you can run the command. It will display paths of your tracked and untracked files.So, basically it will display the difference between "git add" and "git commit"
                        command.But, Remember it will not show any commit records or information.
                        <br>Example:<code>git status</code></p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>git commit:</h3>
                    <p> This command will take everything that is in the index for the Staging area and put it into the local repository.The "-m" option, which stands for "message". Writing good commit messages is a skill.
                        <br> Example:<code> git commit -m "Add
                    files"</code></p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>git push:</h3>
                    <p>When you run this command it will take your local repository that you have created and then push it to the remote repository such as Github.<br> Example:<code> git push &lt;remote> &lt;branch> </code>
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>git pull:</h3>
                    <p>If you want to pull the latest changes from the remote repository to the local repository you can do it using git pull command. This command is mostly useful when you are working in a Team or an Organisation.<br> Example: <code> git pull
                        &lt;remote></code>
                    </p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <h3>git clone: </h3>
                    <p><strong>Clones</strong> are literally clones (copies) of a repository that sit on the developer‚Äôs computer instead of a server elsewhere.</p>
          
                    <p>The git clone command download the existing remote repository on your local computer by specifying the URL of the remote repository.Basically, If you find a program or project that you like on GitHub you can clone it and that will
                        download it in your machine. <br> Example:
                        <code> git clone repoLink
                            <!-- https://github.com/userName/repositoryName.git  -->
                            </code></p>
                </li>
            </ol>
